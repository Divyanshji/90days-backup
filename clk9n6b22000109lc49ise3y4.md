## **Introduction ðŸŒŸ**

The #90DaysOfDevOps challenge is already on Day 5! We'll get into the Advance of Linux shell scripting today and discuss how DevOps engineers might benefit from it.

1. Write a bash script [createDirectories.sh](http://createDirectories.sh) that when the script is executed with three given arguments (one is directory name and second is start number of directories and third is the end number of directories ) it creates specified number of directories with a dynamic directory name.
    

```plaintext
#!/bin/bash 
eval mkdir $1{$2..$3}
```

For creating [createDirectories](http://createDirectories.sh)**.sh** we will use **nano** editor. Enter the text written above. **eval** is a linux command which **used to run the arguments as a shell command.** Here is how I create and run following commands to create many directories in one script.

We pass 3 command line arguments like directory name starting number and ending number. And this got the result.

1. Create a Script to backup all your work done till now.
    
    We will create a backup.sh file and add the content to backup file
    

```plaintext
#!/bin/bash


# set the backup directory path
backup_dir="/path/to/your/backup/directory"


# set the name of the backup file
backup_file="mybackup_$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S").tar.gz"


# create the backup file
tar -czf "$backup_dir/$backup_file" /path/to/your/work/directory


# check if the backup file was created successfully
if [ -f "$backup_dir/$backup_file" ]; then
  echo "Backup created successfully!"
else
  echo "Error: Backup creation failed!"
  exit 1
fi
```

You can save this script in a file named [**backup.sh**](http://backup.sh). Make sure to replace **/path/to/backup/directory** with the actual path of the directory where you want to store the backup, and **/path/to/your/work/directory** with the actual path of the directory containing your work.

You can then execute this script from the terminal using the command **./**[**backup.sh**](http://backup.sh). This will create a backup of all your work in a compressed archive file with a timestamped name, and store it in the backup directory you specified.

1. Read About Cron and Crontab, to automate the backup Script.
    

Cron is the system's main scheduler for running jobs or tasks unattended. A command called crontab allows the user to submit, edit or delete entries to cron. A crontab file is a user file that holds the scheduling information.

Creating a cron job in a shell script involves two steps: writing the shell script with the desired functionality and then setting up the cron job to execute the script at specific intervals.

We have backup.sh, We'll be setting up cron job for this file to run at interval of time. We use following command to open crontab in the default text editor.

```plaintext
crontab -e
```

Add a new line at the end of the crontab to schedule your script. The general syntax for cron jobs is:

```plaintext
* * * * * /path/to/your/script.sh
```

Each asterisk represents a time element (minute, hour, day of the month, month, and day of the week, respectively). For example, to run the script every day at 2:30 PM (14:30):

```plaintext
30 14 * * * /path/to/your/script.sh
```

Save and exit the crontab editor. Your cron job is now set up, and the script will execute at the specified intervals.

**Some additional notes:**

* To view your current crontab entries, use the command `crontab -l`.
    
* Make sure to provide the full absolute path to your script and log file to avoid any path-related issues.
    
* The cron job will run with the environment and permissions of the user who added the cron job.
    
* You can use the `>>` or `>` operator in your script to append or overwrite the log file, respectively, depending on your logging requirements.
    

1. User Management in Linux
    
    Proper user management is crucial for ensuring system security, maintaining data integrity, and providing a smooth computing experience. Let's dive into the world of user management in Linux!
    
    * To add a new user to the system, we use the `useradd` command. For example, to create a user named "shadow," simply run:
        
        ```plaintext
        sudo useradd shadow
        ```
        
    * The next step is to set a password for the new user. We use the `passwd` command to achieve this:
        
        ```plaintext
           $ sudo passwd shadow
        ```
        
    * Should the need arise to remove a user, we employ the `userdel` command:
        
        ```plaintext
        $ sudo userdel shadow
        ```
        
2. Create 2 users and just display their Usernames
    
    We will use the command discussed above.
    
    ```plaintext
    sudo useradd user01
    sudo useradd user02
    ```
    
    This will create 2 users now in order to display them, use this command:-
    
    ```plaintext
    awk -F: '{print $1}' /etc/passwd
    ```
