## What is Python?

Python is fast growing and a **very easy to learn** programming language. It is widely used in the fields of Development, Automation, DevOps, Machine Learning, AI, Big Data and many others. It is versatile in usage yet a very simple programming language to learn.

It offers a simple and readable syntax, making it beginner-friendly and efficient for rapid prototyping.

Python has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks for tasks such as data analysis, machine learning, and web development. Python's integration capabilities and extensive community support make it an essential tool for computer engineers.

## How to install Python?

### Windows:

* Go to [Python's](http://python.org) official website or [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    
* Select the latest version from the top or wanted a specific version scroll down to see more versions.
    
* ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690646963966/0f718e15-dc15-4da6-a588-5b2ec92df5f0.png align="center")
    
* Run the package and follow the on-screen instructions.
    
* Select the option to add Python to your system's PATH environment variable (if available) during the installation process.
    
* Complete the installation by clicking "Install" or "Finish" (depending on the installer).
    
* Open a command prompt or terminal window.
    
* Type `python` or `python3` in the command prompt and press Enter to verify the installation and check the Python version.
    
* If the installation was successful, you should see the Python interpreter prompt, indicating that Python is installed and ready to use.
    

### Linux

* In Linux, we will install python3 using the command line.
    
* Open the Terminal and update the system `sudo apt update`
    
* Now install python3 with the following command `sudo apt install python3`, When Prompted enter `Y` to proceed.
    
* In order to check if Python is properly installed use `python3 --version`
    

## Data types in Python

There are various Data types in Python. Python is a dynamically typed programing language, Which means you don't have to define the type of the variable, variable can be created and assigned and the same time.

We can get the type of variables by `type()` function.

Different Datatypes are:

* <mark>int</mark> - holds signed integers of non-limited length.
    
    `i=100`
    
* <mark>float</mark> - holds floating precision numbers and it‚Äôs accurate up to 15 decimal places.
    
    `f = 10.5`
    
* <mark>boolean</mark> - holds only True Or False.
    
    `b = True`
    
* <mark>string</mark> - The string is a sequence of characters. Python supports Unicode characters. Generally, strings are represented by either single or double quotes.
    
    `name="Divyansh"`
    
* <mark>list</mark> - Lists¬†are just like **arrays**, declared in other languages which is an ordered collection of data. It is very flexible as the items in a list do not need to be of the **same type**. Lists are mutable.
    
    Lists in Python can be created by just placing the sequence inside the square brackets\[\].
    
    `l = ["Divyansh", "Jain"]`
    
* <mark>dictionary</mark> - Python Dictionary is an unordered sequence of data of key-value pair form. It is similar to the hash table type. Dictionaries are written within curly braces in the form¬†key: value. It is very useful to retrieve data in an optimized way among a large amount of data.
    
    `d = {"name": "Divyansh", "surname": "Jain"}`
    
* <mark>range</mark> - Range is a built-in function to generate a sequence of integers with specified start, stop, and step values.
    
    `r = range(100)`
    
* <mark>set</mark> - Set is an unordered collection of unique elements
    
    `s ={'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}`
    
* <mark>tuple</mark> - The tuple is another data type which is a sequence of data similar to a list. But it is immutable. That means data in a tuple is write-protected. Data in a tuple is written using parenthesis ( ) and commas
    
    `t = ("Divyansh", "Jain")`
