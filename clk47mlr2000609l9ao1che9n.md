# **What is DevOps?**

DevOps is a methodology that bridges the gap between developers and operations.

Basically, it eliminate the problem of not running application in different environments.

Traditionally, development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams have operated independently, leading to silos, inefficiencies, and delays in the software development lifecycle. DevOps seeks to bridge this gap by fostering a culture of collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement.

# **Why DevOps is Important?**

DevOps helps to build the product fast and effectively with the help of automation. It increases the scalability of a product and reduces the cost of an organisation. DevOps helps us improve :

*Collaboration and Communication*

*Faster Time-to-Market*

*Enhanced Quality and Reliability*

*Improved Customer Satisfaction*

*Continuous Improvement*

# **What is Automation, Scaling, Infrastructure**

**Automation** is the practice of using specialized tools to automate repetitive and manual tasks throughout the software development lifecycle.

**Scaling** is the capability of a system to handle an increasing workload or accommodate growing demands. It is the secret ingredient behind ensuring your software can handle growth and changing demands. By scaling horizontally (adding more servers) or vertically (upgrading existing servers), we guarantee that our applications remain performant and reliable, even during peak usage periods.

**Infrastructure** concept refers to the idea of managing servers with the help of code. Infrastructure is a foundation that enables the smooth functioning of software applications. It encompasses the hardware, software, networks, and configurations needed to create an environment where applications can run efficiently and securely.

By adopting DevOps principles and practices, organizations can achieve faster time-to-market, improved software quality, increased efficiency, and better customer satisfaction.

I hope this introduction provides you with a good starting point to further into the world of DevOps! And adds value to your existing knowledge.
